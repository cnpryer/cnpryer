# Hi, I'm [Chris](https://cnpryer.com) ðŸ‘‹

I enjoy contributing to projects I depend on, like [Ruff's Python formatter](https://astral.sh/blog/the-ruff-formatter). I build and share tools like [Huak](https://github.com/cnpryer/huak) -- an experiment with Python package management. I'm a Principal Software Engineer at [NFI](https://nfiindustries.com).
